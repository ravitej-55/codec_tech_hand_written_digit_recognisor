# Handwritten Digit Recognizer using CNN

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## How it works
- Loads and preprocesses MNIST data.
- Builds a CNN model.
- Trains and evaluates on digit images (0-9).

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy

## Usage
Run `mnist_cnn.ipynb` in Google Colab, or use the code in any Python environment with the mentioned libraries.

## Results
The trained model achieves above 98% accuracy on MNIST test images.
